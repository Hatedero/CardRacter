# CardRacter

Card-Racter (pun intended) is a kotlin based mobile application.
It's goal is to be used as a character manager, with the use of cards. 

Any user can simply create a new character in a few steps. In order to be used  for various means (dnd, homebrew, writing, ..), user can create custom categories and fill them as they wish, allowing for a truly customisable experience.

If you're  simply looking for inspiration, you can take a look at the main page, where trending cards will be available. Clicking on one show more details about the character.

And, for dungeon masters, writers or similar, you also have the option to create collections and groups of characters.
